### Mission

#### Tentative de pitch:

Tackling health problems such as antibiotic resistance and cancer is extremely difficult and challenging.
This is because humans and microbial communities living inside them form very complex biological systems.

Biology needs to, and is becoming, more and more quantitative.
This is because intuitive, qualitative reasoning is not enough to make sense of complex biological systems.
Mathematical and computational models are more and more needed to enable impactful biological research: the data **alone** is too rich, complex and noisy.

However, today, only a limited number of highly trained scientists have the skills, expertise and knowledge to define a meaningful mathematical model of a biological system, to write code to simulate it, and to analyse its results.
And even for those experts, it takes time and a lot of coding (and debugging) to turn a model drawn on paper to actual working code.

**We believe this does not have to be the case**.

We want to **help biologists with little modeling expertise** to construct, simulate and interpret computer models of biological experiments to accelerate their research.

We want to **help expert modelers** to focus on the modeling by freeing them from the burden of writing and debugging simulation code, running the code on cluster machines, getting the data back, storing and organizing it, parsing it for analysis...

This is our mission at **find cool name**.
Try it, you will love it.
